# Cartosky Tutorial

Welcome to [`cartosky`](https://github.com/kadrlica/cartosky)!
At its core, `cartosky` is a wrapper around [`cartopy`](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/), with additional features to make it suitable for looking up at the sky rather than looking down at the Earth.

This is is a brief tutorial consisting of ipython notebooks that should get you up to speed with `cartosky` and its features.

* [Tutorial 1: Base Skymap Class](tutorial_baseclass.ipynb)
* [Tutorial 2: Surveys](tutorial_surveys.ipynb)
* [Tutorial 3: HealSparse and Healpix Maps](tutorial_healsparse.ipynb)
